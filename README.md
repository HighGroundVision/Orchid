## Getting Started

The Follow application settings need to be set before the system will function
```
"Site": {
	"SteamUsername": "",
	"SteamPassword": ""
}
```

The settings can be found in the appsettings.json file but we recommand using [user secrets](https://docs.asp.net/en/latest/security/app-secrets.html) instead.
